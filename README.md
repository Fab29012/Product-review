## My process
As usual, I start out by visualizing everything and then i start my html code, I no longer feel the need to do my css at the same time. I even find it better to build out the project in html first and then one by one work on the css. The one thing I had to look up to do was how to include my icon in my button, at the beginning i wanted to use an input with type="button" but didn't know how to continue and so after some research that is when i discovered the "button" element which allowed me to add my icon with text using the span element. 

### What I learned
Like i said the one thing that was completely new to me was the button function. 
<button class="cart-btn">
          <span><img class="carticon" src="/Users/fabiennehalloin/Desktop/HTML Challenges/product-preview-card-component-main/images/icon-cart.svg" alt="cart-icon"></span>
          <span class="cart-text">Add to Cart</span>
        </button>
